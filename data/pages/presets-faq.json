  "bodyHtml": "<div><h3>What are presets?</h3><p>A preset is a configuration of settings, fine-tuned to give your photos a signature look in one simple click using Adobe Lightroom. This helps you save time when editing new pictures and gives your images a professional aesthetic without spending months learning everything from scratch.</p><h3>What’s the difference between Desktop and Mobile presets?</h3><p>There are two versions of the Adobe Lightroom editing software – a Desktop software and a Mobile app. The Desktop version is a powerful program that gives you a lot of control but you need to pay a subscription fee (around $10/month) to download and use it. The Mobile Lightroom app is free and you can download it from the app store. Desktop presets don’t work with the mobile app and vice versa. That’s why we offer our presets in both versions.</p><h3>I'm new to Lightroom, can I still use your presets?</h3><p>Absolutely! In fact, our presets are designed especially to help those with little editing knowledge to achieve a professional look.</p><h3>Are your downloads instant? How do I receive them?</h3><p>Yes, all of our downloads are instant. They are sent to you via email immediately after payment is completed.</p><h3>What comes with the presets?</h3><p>With every preset pack we also send a step by step PDF guide to show you how to import and use the presets.</p></div>",
